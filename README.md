**Heart Disease Prediction

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict heart disease based on a dataset of patients' health metrics. The goal is to classify the presence or absence of heart disease using various machine learning algorithms.

Requirements

The project is implemented in Python, using the following libraries:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
Install the required packages using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Notebook Overview
Data Exploration: The dataset is first explored to understand its structure, types, and statistics.
Data Preprocessing: Features are prepared for model training by encoding categorical variables and normalizing numerical values.
Model Training: Several machine learning models are trained, including:
Random Forest Classifier
Extra Trees Classifier
Voting Classifier (an ensemble of multiple models)
Evaluation: The models are evaluated based on accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.
Usage
To run the notebook locally, use the following steps:

Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-disease-prediction.git
Navigate to the directory:
bash
Copy code
cd heart-disease-prediction
Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Open and run the Jupyter notebook:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook Heart_disease.ipynb
Results
The models are evaluated using accuracy, precision, and recall. The Random Forest and Extra Trees models showed promising results in predicting heart disease. The ensemble model (Voting Classifier) helped in improving the overall performance.

Future Improvements
Hyperparameter tuning to further improve model accuracy.
Experimenting with other advanced machine learning algorithms like Gradient Boosting.
Incorporating feature selection techniques to reduce dimensionality and improve performance.
